Microbiome Notes:
- Microbiome refers to the distribution of different microbial "species" at a target site.
- Species classified into OTUs (operational taxonomic unit),
 essentially pragmatic classification of species in absence of standard macroscopic organism
 species classification
- OTUs grouped wrt DNA sequence simlarity of a marker gene
- 16S rRNA is the typical gene marker used, as it is highly conserved between species
"the function of the 16S rRNA gene over time has not changed,
 suggesting that random sequence changes are a more accurate measure of time (evolution)"

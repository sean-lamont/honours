  abstract =      {Principal Components Analysis (PCA) as a method of multivariate statistics was created before the Second World War. However, the wider application of this method only occurred in the 1960s, during the â€œQuantitative Revolutionâ€� in the Natural and Social Sciences. The main reason for this time-lag was the huge difficulty posed by calculations involving this method. Only with the advent and development of computers did the almost unlimited application of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components, become possible. At the same time, requirements arose for precise numerical methods concerning, among other things, the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, because the application of principal components to technical problems required absolute accuracy. On the other hand, numerous applications in Social Sciences gave rise to a significant increase in the ability to interpret these nonobservable variables, which is just what the principal components are. In the application of principal components, the problem is not only to do with their formal properties but above all, their empirical origins. The authors considered these two tendencies during the creation of the program for principal components. This programâ€”entitled PCAâ€”accompanies this paper. It analyzes consecutively, matrices of variance-covariance and correlations, and performs the following functions: â€¢- the determination of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices.â€¢- the testing of principal components.â€¢- the calculation of coefficients of determination between selected components and the initial variables, and the testing of these coefficients,â€¢- the determination of the share of variation of all the initial variables in the variation of particular components,â€¢- construction of a dendrite for the initial set of variables,â€¢- the construction of a dendrite for a selected pattern of the principal components,â€¢- the scatter of the objects studied in a selected coordinate system. Thus, the PCA program performs many more functions especially in testing and graphics, than PCA programs in conventional statistical packages. Included in this paper are a theoretical description of principal components, the basic rules for their interpretation and also statistical testing.},

  abstract      = {Ruminants provide essential nutrition for billions of people worldwide. The rumen is a specialized stomach that is adapted to the breakdown of plant-derived complex polysaccharides. The genomes of the rumen microbiota encode thousands of enzymes adapted to digestion of the plant matter that dominates the ruminant diet. We assembled 4,941 rumen microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using approximately 6.5 terabases of short- and long-read sequence data from 283 ruminant cattle. We present a genome-resolved metagenomics workflow that enabled assembly of bacterial and archaeal genomes that were at least 80% complete. Of note, we obtained three single-contig, whole-chromosome assemblies of rumen bacteria, two of which represent previously unknown rumen species, assembled from long-read data. Using our rumen genome collection we predicted and annotated a large set of rumen proteins. Our set of rumen MAGs increases the rate of mapping of rumen metagenomic sequencing reads from 15% to 50-70%. These genomic and protein resources will enable a better understanding of the structure and functions of the rumen microbiota.},

There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},

A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.]},

abstract = "This paper presents the results of an investigation into the use of machine learning methods for the identification of narcotics from Raman spectra. The classification of spectral data and other high-dimensional data, such as images, gene-expression data and spectral data, poses an interesting challenge to machine learning, as the presence of high numbers of redundant or highly correlated attributes can seriously degrade classification accuracy. This paper investigates the use of principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce high-dimensional spectral data and to improve the predictive performance of some well-known machine learning methods. Experiments are carried out on a high-dimensional spectral dataset. These experiments employ the NIPALS (Non-Linear Iterative Partial Least Squares) PCA method, a method that has been used in the field of chemometrics for spectral classification, and is a more efficient alternative than the widely used eigenvector decomposition approach. The experiments show that the use of this PCA method can improve the performance of machine learning in the classification of high-dimensional data."

	abstract = {Although much work has linked the human microbiome to specific phenotypes and lifestyle variables, data from different projects have been challenging to integrate and the extent of microbial and molecular diversity in human stool remains unknown. Using standardized protocols from the Earth Microbiome Project and sample contributions from over 10,000 citizen-scientists, together with an open research network, we compare human microbiome specimens primarily from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia to one another and to environmental samples. Our results show an unexpected range of beta-diversity in human stool microbiomes compared to environmental samples; demonstrate the utility of procedures for removing the effects of overgrowth during room-temperature shipping for revealing phenotype correlations; uncover new molecules and kinds of molecular communities in the human stool metabolome; and examine emergent associations among the microbiome, metabolome, and the diversity of plants that are consumed (rather than relying on reductive categorical variables such as veganism, which have little or no explanatory power). We also demonstrate the utility of the living data resource and cross-cohort comparison to confirm existing associations between the microbiome and psychiatric illness and to reveal the extent of microbiome change within one individual during surgery, providing a paradigm for open microbiome research and education.IMPORTANCE We show that a citizen science, self-selected cohort shipping samples through the mail at room temperature recaptures many known microbiome results from clinically collected cohorts and reveals new ones. Of particular interest is integrating n = 1 study data with the population data, showing that the extent of microbiome change after events such as surgery can exceed differences between distinct environmental biomes, and the effect of diverse plants in the diet, which we confirm with untargeted metabolomics on hundreds of samples.},

## Week 3 Meeting Notes:
From the meeting this week, there were several points:
- By the end of March we should be fairly certain what approach we will be taking. For example, applying Linear Regression to Compositional Data or PCA to Directional Data
- To help decide, Christian proposed replicating the empirical results of the NeurIPS paper on CoDA-PCA.
- To help my understanding, it was proposed that I summarise and compare directional and compositional data. 
- One potential idea was to work out how Linear Regression works for Compositional Data without the transformation to the hypersphere (rather than in the transformed directional space).
- I am to let my supervisors know when assessment is due, otherwise they will assume a light workload. 
- The main work for now to decide what the project will focus on before the end of March.
- Histograms are a good start. What is a histogram formally and why is it compositional? Why is it not a barplot? 
- Specialising paper to histograms? (PCA for histograms)
-	Histograms for Linear Regression or PCA (pick one) 
-	Find datasetâ€¦ Generalised Aitchinson Embeddings paper a good start. 
-	Generate toy compositional 3D dataset
-	Implement PCA and Linear Regression from Scratch
-	Toy datasets to help conceptualise (generate for concepts eg compositional and directional)
-	Notebooks in the GitHub
-	Proper python editor for package
-	Test Driven Dev. 
-	Reference Manager/Reading list manager (Zotero)

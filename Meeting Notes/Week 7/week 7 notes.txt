- Find compositional datasets

- Decide on overall approach. Candidates:
	- LSTM for time series economics (or other) data

	- "inverse" regression/classification, i.e. compositions as targets
		- REGRESSION FOR COMPOSITIONAL DATA WITH COMPOSITIONAL DATA AS PREDICTOR VARIABLES WITH OR WITHOUT ZERO VALUES

		- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05036.pdf (Includes Dataset!!!)

	- End to end optimisation, optimising a cost function on both the 
	  classification/regression accuracy and the reconstruction error
		- Need to think about why we care about reconstruction error
			- In practice, PCA often improves performance on high dimensional data
				- Serves almost as a way of regularising, as applying models to
			  	raw data makes it hard to figure out what is actually 
			  	causing a pattern
			- Data processing inequality: information cannot be gained from processing
			- Why do end to end? Possibly better generalisations since the dim reduction
			  serves to reduce overfitting and allow the model to extract useful relationships
			  out of the data

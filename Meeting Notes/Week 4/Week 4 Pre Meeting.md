# Week 4 Pre Meeting Notes
 Did 2 things (mainly) last week: 
 
 - Further Reading: Went through the Le Paper on Aitchinson Embeddings in a fair amount of detail (~60-70% of the technical stuff). A summary of my thoughts can be found in the GitHub Literature Review Folder. The datasets here seem interesting (as well as industry standard), and are all supervised. Would be a useful comparison if we end up taking a supervised approach (although these are all classification with nearest neighbors). 
 - Plenty of revision for linear regression and PCA, implemented both methods in Python Notebooks (also on GitHub)
 - I also generated some toy 3D compositional data and played around with that in another notebook (just taking the transformations and plotting them after PCA)

## Goals for week 4: 

- Continue with literature review and background reading; What papers to do next? e.g go through Correspondence Analysis textbook, or focus more on another perspective... I'm still not committed to any particular approach. 
- Implementing the algorithms and generating toy data, and maybe replicating results, seems to be a good thing to continue with. When I start on the actual research component I think it will be easier if I have all that code at hand.

# Week 5 Pre Meeting Notes
This week I:

- Looked through and helped process and digitalise datasets from Aitchinson's appendix. Also looked more into the data from the highly impactful Microbiome paper (see week 4 notes for details on this)
- Read through the implementation details of CoDA-PCA. Still some work before I understand it, but I took the code from the paper and applied CoDA-PCA and CLR-PCA to some of Aitchinson's data. Using this as the preprocessing for regression, the CoDA-PCA preprocessed features gave better predictive power than those from CLR-PCA, which in turn performed better than naive regression on the raw data. 

## Week 5 Goals:
Will discuss details in the meeting, but I assume: 

- More dataset work (inc. fixing some of the formatting of Aitchinson data)
- Testing CoDA-PCA as preprocessing for regression on more datasets
- Playing around with the CoDA-PCA framework, e.g plotting 
- More reading..

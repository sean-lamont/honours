# Abstract
 There is an abundance of scientific data which can be considered compositional, which is to say that the components are non-negative and their sum is unitary. Such data can be interpreted as normalised ratios between the components, and their analyses are complicated by the fact that they exist in a non-Euclidean mathematical space. As such, any attempt to compare distances between elements of this space cannot take place in the standard manner. Aitchinson (ref.) was the first to treat this issue in depth. At the core of Aitchinson's approach was the idea of a log transformation. For a point on the simplex, applying such a transformation would embed the point in Euclidean space and so enable standard distance comparisons.
